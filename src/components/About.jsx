        With a solid foundation in programming and 4 years of hands-on
        experience as a front-end web developer, I've consistently honed my
        skills to deliver efficient and sophisticated web solutions. I hold a
        Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Free University of Tbilisi, where
        my academic journey initially steered me towards astrophysics. During
        this period, I had the privilege of contributing to the scientific
        community with a published paper.

        My academic exposure to languages such as C++, Java, Matlab, and Wolfram
        Mathematica laid the groundwork for my transition into programming.
        Pursuing a further specialization, I undertook a rigorous 6-month course
        in front-end web development.

      <p className="py-1 sm:py-2 text-white text-sm md:text-lg xl:text-lg">
        In the subsequent years, I enriched my proficiency by tutoring
        JavaScript and engaging in front-end development roles. My experience
        includes a significant tenure of over 2 years with a fully remote German
        startup, reflecting my adaptability and commitment to delivering in
        dynamic work environments.

      <p className="py-1 sm:py-2 text-white text-sm md:text-lg xl:text-lg">
        I'm driven by a passion for web development and a continuous desire to
        deepen and swiftly expand my expertise in the domain.
