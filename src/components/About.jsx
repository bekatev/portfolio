      Over the past four years, I’ve worked remotely as a front-end developer, delivering responsive, user-focused web applications. With a background in physics from the Free University of Tbilisi, I transitioned into web development early in my career, driven by a deep interest in building interactive, performant user interfaces.

      Working with multiple international teams taught me to communicate clearly, manage time effectively, and deliver consistent results across different time zones. I’ve led front-end efforts on projects where clean design, scalability, and maintainability were critical. I’m fluent in modern frameworks, and I continuously adopt best practices in testing, accessibility, and performance optimization.
