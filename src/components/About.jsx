        Over the past 4+ years, I've worked remotely as a front-end developer
        for a German company.. Being a Bachelor of Physics graduate from the
        Free University of Tbilisi, I began learning web development in my early
        years and decided to shift my professional direction toward front-end
        development.. My jobs taught me the value of clear communication, time
        management, and collaboration with international teams to build
        responsive web apps.

      <p className="py-1 sm:py-2 text-bckg text-sm md:text-lg xl:text-lg">
        I'm always eager to grow as a developer, learning new technologies and
        improving my skills in areas like design and testing. I aim to
        continuously evolve, push my limits, and build innovative applications.
        I'm also excited to join new communities, share knowledge, and learn
        from others.
