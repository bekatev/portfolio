        My academic exposure to languages such as C++, Java, Matlab, and Wolfram
        Mathematica laid the groundwork for my transition into programming.
        Pursuing a further specialization, I undertook a rigorous 6-month course
        in front-end web development.

        In addition to honing my skills through tutoring JavaScript and various
        front-end roles, I've spent over three years with a fully remote German
        company as a front-end developer. This experience underscores my
        adaptability and dedication to delivering results in dynamic work
        environments.

        My main tools of choice include React and Vue, complemented by Tailwind
        CSS for streamlined styling. These technologies have been instrumental
        in crafting sophisticated and user-friendly interfaces.
